//todo the purpose of the reducer pattern is to make the logic more declarative.

//e is the state, but because it is async, we must decorate the state, and not replace it.
//reducer is a pure(-ish) function. It can get data from outside, and it can use only the data in the incoming state.
//errors needs to be masked on a reducer/reducer basis.

//the properties of the context object is *both* a property *and* a state marker at the same time.
//the property is both a point in space and a point in time.

//when more than one promise leads to a property, then first come first serve.
//This way, reducers can race to reach a point in space/time, and only the first reducer will fill the space/win the race.
//a reducer will not start until all its marked dependencies are fulfilled.

//This is a time/machine, as much as it is a state.
